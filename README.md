# dairnarth/nvim

My small but growing neovim configuration as I slowly become more proficient in the editor.

## File Structure

I've taken to organising my configuration into smaller files in the plugin directory rather than simply storing it all in my init.vim file.
This is currently more of a preventative measure, given the size of the files, but I feel that it will become necessary as I inevitably make more tweaks and changes.
